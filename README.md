# Customer Segmentation Using Credit Card Data

This project uses credit card data to perform customer segmentation using the K-means clustering algorithm. 

Customer segmentation groups customers based on shared characteristics and behaviors, allowing businesses to customize marketing strategies and services to maximize customer value.

The dataset is available on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjunbhasin2013/ccdata).

Some clusters identified include:
1. A high-value, premier group characterized by high spending, high credit limit, and high percentage of full payments, who can be targets of special offers and rewards
2. A high-risk group characterized by high balance, high cash advance, and low percentage of full payments, likely indicating customers with high debt
3. A high-risk group characterized by low overall spending, low purchase frequency, and low percentage of full payments
